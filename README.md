TouhouCV is an automated player for the bullet hell games in the **Touhou Project**. For the uninitiated, a bullet hell game is a subgenre of **Shoot 'em up** video games, where the player controls a ship which must dodge obstacles, and attack enemies.

This bot uses computer vision techniques to extract relevant data from gameplay in order to make decisions regarding player control, to successfully play the game.
